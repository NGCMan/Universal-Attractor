<h1>Generators</h1>
<div>Generators can generate stars or lower tiered ones (1st tier generates stars). Stars is the main currency that is produced by generators, which you can buy more generators from these stars.<br><br>You get a x1.05 production upgrade for each purchase.</div>
<h1>Prestige</h1>
<div>When you feel like you aren't making more progress after a while, you can reset the game for prestige power, which increases all generator production. Prestige requires e39 stars to reset (reduced by an upgrade), and prestige power is multiplicative.</div>
<h1>Transfer</h1>
<div>Transfer, another prestige layer, resets your prestige power in exchange for a different currency, transfer points. By transfering, you can get access to transfer upgrades. <br><br>You get your first transfer point by reaching 100x prestige power, and points increase with higher prestige power.
	The upgrades in trasfer increase progress, including the ability for gaining more transfer points over power, and more prestige power over transfer points.</div>
<h1>Supernova</h1>
<div>In Javascript, the limit of all normal numbers is ~1.79769313e308, which after displays Infinity. Reaching Infinity stars (overflow), will force you to go supernova, including transfer points and upgrades being reset, but gives neutron stars. <br><br>Every single supernova will give you 1 neutron stars, which you can spend on supernova content.</div>
<h2>Supernova Upgrades</h2>
<div>Supernova Upgrades is the first content under Supernova. These upgrades can boost overall progression, including generators, prestige, and transfer content.</div>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<div>Achievements are awards that increase production unlocked after Supernova, with difficulty based on the objective of the achievement. The rewards of this pack is related to the achievement.</div>
<h2>Autobuyers</h2>
<div>Autobuyers is the second content under supernova. After reaching Infinity, you are now able to automate the game. Autobuyers are unlocked when beating challenges.<br><br>
	Autobuyers have an interval of when it can perform/buy something, and interval can be decreased with neutron stars (40% reduction, with a limit to 10 milliseconds)</div>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<div>Challenges is the third content under supernova. Challenges are special progressions that you have to start over and have to reach Infinity with special conditions. Some supernova upgrades are disabled in all challenges.<br><br>
	After completing a challenge for the first time, you will get a reward box that takes some time to unlock, but unlocks autobuyers. The length of unlocking a reward box increases with every challenge.</div>
<h2>Buyinshop</h2>
<div>Buyinshop is the fourth content under supernova. It's a shop that involves shop features for autobuyers.<br><br>
	Some buyinshop features are expensive that you recommend to break limit! After reaching million neutron stars, you notice you can supernova automatically in no time!</div>
<h2>Neutron boosts</h2>
<div>Neutron boosts is the fifth content under supernova. Beside neutron boosts, you are able to break the limit of "Infinity" (~1.79769313e308)! Having more stars above 1.8e308 allows getting more neutron stars in fewer supernovas.<br><br>
	There are repeating upgrades that increase the production of the generators, including PP gain, but has a limit to how many you can buy.</div>
<h2>Neutron tiers</h2>
<div>Neutron tiers are like the set of generators, all neutron tiers are unlocked but have the cost of neutron stars and higher bonuses for buying it.<br><br>
	Neutron tiers function like generators, having higher tiers produce lower tiers, but the 1st tier produces neutrons, reducing generator cost.</div>
